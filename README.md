## 🛡️ AI-Based Web Application Firewall (WAF)
## 📌 Overview

This project is a **proof-of-concept Web Application Firewall (WAF)** that leverages **machine learning** to detect and block anomalous or malicious web traffic in real-time.

Traditional WAFs rely on rule-based detection (like static signatures), which may fail to catch **zero-day attacks** or **evasive behaviors**.
This AI-based WAF aims to enhance detection by learning from traffic patterns and adapting over time.

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**

   * Collected datasets representing both **normal** and **malicious** HTTP requests.
   * Preprocessing included feature extraction (e.g., request method, URL patterns, headers).

2. **Model Training**

   * Trained machine learning models such as:
     * Random forest
     * 
   * Used labeled traffic data to teach the model to distinguish between benign and harmful traffic.

3. **Real-time Traffic Analysis**

   * Built a web interface using **Flask**.
   * Integrated real-time detection pipeline to inspect incoming requests.

4. **Threat Detection Enhancement**

   * The system continuously improves by learning from new traffic.
   * Potential to integrate with **Snort** or other IDS tools for enhanced alerting.

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Flask** – Web server for interfacing with HTTP requests
* **Snort** – For integrating traditional rule-based detection
* **Jupyter Notebook** – For data exploration and model development

### 🎯 Benefits

* ✅ Detects complex attack patterns using behavior, not just signatures
* ✅ Adapts over time as new data is introduced
* ✅ Can be extended to detect XSS, SQLi, and other common web attacks
